# How To

## JSON Compatibility with Pathbuilder 2e and FoundryVTT Pathfinder 2e Creature JSONs

To make use of the automatic rolling feature, a user can download a json of their player sheets from [Pathbuilder 2e](https://pathbuilder2e.com/) by clicking:

![menu icon](https://github.com/hrick87/Pathfinder-2e-Init-Tracker/blob/master/readme-images/menu.png?raw=true)

then

![menu icon](https://github.com/hrick87/Pathfinder-2e-Init-Tracker/blob/master/readme-images/export.png?raw=true)

and placing the json file inside the players folder. Finally, rename the file to "player(unique number starting with 1)".
Example json player sheets are included in the repository for further clarity.

Similary, an enemy json file can be downlaoded from [FoundryVTT Pathfinder 2e](https://github.com/foundryvtt/pf2e) 
and placing it inside the enmies folder. No renaming of a file is necessary in this instance. Example json enemy sheets are included in the repository for further clarity.

Finally, when prompted by the program to read in JSON files, select the option as shown below.

# Initative tracking

The rest of the program should be self-explanatory as I have included detailed prompts on how and what to type at each point. If something is unclear or incorrect, please open an issue on this github repository. Happy GMing!
